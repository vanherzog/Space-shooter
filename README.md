A Space Shooter game that is made within 2-3 days with Unity. Due to a really tense schedule, 
I am not able to improve the game visually and logically. 
I hope you stil enjoy.

Keys:
- Space/Left click: Shoot 
- 1: Special attack 
- 2: Special attack
- G: Godmode (you cant be killed)
- R: Menu

You are not allowed to get hit once. The opponents have varying HP.
If you finish wave 5, all the opponents are the same, but they shoot and fly faster and you get 1 extra HP, meaning you can get hit twice.
