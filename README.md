A Space Shooter game that is made within 2-3 days with Unity. Due to a really tense schedule, 
I am not able to improve the game visually and logically. 
I hope you stil enjoy.



Keys:
- Space/Left click: Shoot 
- 1: Special attack 
- 2: Special attack

you are not allowed to get hit once. The opponents have varying HP.
